# Celestial Ripple Effect

## Overview

This project is an interactive **shader experiment** built with **React Three Fiber (R3F)** and **GLSL**. It creates a **sepia-black-and-white transformation effect** combined with **expanding ripples and shimmering particles**, triggered by a click. The effect is designed to feel **organic, ethereal, and fluid**, blending procedural techniques with artistic direction.

## Features

- **Sepia to Black & White Transition** – Gradual desaturation with a subtle golden tint.
- **Expanding Radial Ripples** – Simulated distortion waves that animate outward.
- **Shimmering Particles** – Dynamic highlights that appear along the expanding transition ring.
- **Ambient Ripples** – Slow, subtle distortions when the effect is idle.
- **Click Activation** – The effect is triggered when clicking on the screen.

## Technologies Used

- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** – For rendering 3D elements in the browser.
- **GLSL Shaders** – Custom fragment shader for image processing.
- **Three.js** – Underlying WebGL engine for texture manipulation.
